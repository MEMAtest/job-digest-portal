Enhanced Full Guide v2.2 — Delivery Portfolio Ademola Omosanya | Senior Manager – Project Delivery Scope: Delivery narrative across ViewPoint/VPoint, VScreen, Enate and Fenergo (2023–2026). Note: Evidence reference strings removed for readability. Underlying artefacts exist in Microsoft 365 (emails/files/meetings). Executive Summary (1 page) Senior delivery lead across screening, workflow and CLM platforms, focused on operationalising controls (SLA/QC), enabling reporting, and unblocking delivery through configuration analysis and data migration scheduling. Top achievements (high-signal) Defined and documented the screening SLA/KPI framework for operational roles and measurement scope. Established a scalable Quality Control operating model (process, sampling approach, templates and jurisdiction reporting structure). Enabled enterprise MI access patterns for screening dashboards with role-based/jurisdiction-restricted visibility and controlled access workflow. Produced structured configuration gap analysis for CLM implementation (journeys, policy coverage, risk model and reference data) to drive prioritised working sessions. Enabled reporting delivery by pairing user guidance with underlying technical reporting design artefacts and consistent access comms. Owned bulk upload scheduling remediation for launch/due date validation constraints and introduced a controlled test-first rollout approach. Supported programme cadence through structured weekly update packs and UAT readiness sequencing (training/UAT, fix/retest, go-live criteria). Created/maintained test scenario packs for journey validation (e.g., maintenance journeys) to standardise UAT execution and outcomes capture. Stakeholder &amp; Governance map (who / how decisions happened) This map is designed for interviewers and internal stakeholders to quickly understand how you worked across business, technology, vendors and oversight functions. Stakeholder groups (typical interfaces) Business owners / operations leaders (Customer Acceptance / Onboarding / Service Delivery). Oversight functions (Compliance, Risk, Audit) — policy alignment, reporting needs, governance assurance. Technology delivery (Architecture, Data &amp; Analytics / BI, Platform/Product teams). Application support (BAU triage, access provisioning, ticketing and handover). Vendors / partners (platform configurators, implementation consultants). Governance rhythm (how work was managed) Weekly programme updates (status, risks, next milestones across workstreams). Working groups by domain: policy/risk, security/access, reporting, data migration/bulk uploads. UAT cadence: intro sessions → system testing → business scenario testing → fixes/retest → readiness/go-live criteria. Operational enablement: user comms, guides, drop-in sessions, and feedback loops. Decision and escalation model (practical) Operate with a written ‘baseline’ (SOP/SLA/QC) before scaling; then iterate via controlled change requests. Use small-sample validation before scaling high-impact bulk changes (e.g., scheduling logic). Keep a single source of truth for status (issue logs/trackers) and reflect decisions into SOPs and comms.

Case Studies (tight — 6–8 lines each) 6. Artefact Catalogue (titles only) 2) Role Summary This section translates delivery activity into clear responsibilities (ownership vs coordination) suitable for CVs, interview narratives and performance documentation. Core responsibility areas ViewPoint/VPoint: migration integrity, access/admin governance, BAU investigations and workflow change requests. VScreen: go-live readiness and operationalisation (SLA/KPI, QC operating model, MI/reporting enablement). Enate: workflow operating model and configuration (allocation model, triggers/reference data, early reporting/MI). Fenergo: configuration analysis and reporting enablement; bulk upload scheduling controls and exception management. 3) Workstream Overview 2023 — ViewPoint / VPoint Primary themes: masterfile data integrity, screening-impacting data quality, admin group/access governance, BAU investigations and workflow change requests. Key responsibilities Access onboarding and admin group governance (user access, admin group changes, jurisdiction/user visibility). Masterfile data integrity analysis for SAP B1 → ViewPoint migration; classification of name/data issues and remediation proposals. BAU investigations and change requests impacting screening volumes and workflows (alert spikes, workflow amendments, regulatory reporting requests). Operational knowledge capture (usage notes; working notes on mapping/reporting considerations). Representative outputs Migration integrity report-style documentation (masterfile records and screening implications). Issue breakdown decks (name/data quality patterns and proposed actions). Operational reference notes for ViewPoint/VPoint usage. 2024 — VScreen Primary themes: go-live/parallel run closure, SLA/KPI definition, QC operating model, Power BI reporting enablement, and mapping alignment (Napier/VScreen ↔ ViewPoint). Key responsibilities Coordinated go-live and parallel run closure activities; aligned stakeholders on stopping legacy batch processing once parallel run was complete. Defined Power BI dashboard requirements across Global/Local/Operational views and owned the enhancement backlog (SLA/TAT, user performance, match/discount visibility, multi-select jurisdictions, QC integration). Established the QC operating model: process documentation, sampling methodology, templates, and jurisdiction QC reporting outputs. Provided MI/data extract support (discounted hit analysis, on-demand threshold stats, True Match IDs, and report delivery/format alignment). Maintained mapping artefacts for Napier/VScreen ↔ ViewPoint. Representative outputs SLA/KPI metric guide for screening roles. QC process document updates and QC templates. Power BI reporting notes + dashboard build artefacts. 2025 — Enate + Fenergo Primary themes: workflow configuration and rollout readiness (Enate), CLM configuration analysis and reporting enablement (Fenergo), and bulk upload scheduling controls. Enate — key responsibilities Produced/iterated onboarding workflow framework and documented required process changes. Defined operating model for allocation (queues/workbaskets) and notification behaviours. Owned configuration detail for triggers and reference data; coordinated alignment with upstream picklists and data standards. Built and shared initial in-platform dashboards and early post go-live MI; guided users on report access. Fenergo — key responsibilities Produced configuration gap analysis across journeys, policy coverage and risk model requirements for multi-jurisdiction delivery. Coordinated security/access preparation and role discussions (UAT readiness; role selection guidance). Owned reporting enablement: user guidance and production dashboard access resources. Maintained policy reference workbooks explaining backend conditionality (configuration rulebook). Owned bulk upload execution and scheduling controls: confirmed uploads, resolved scheduling validation failures, managed long-dated scheduling exceptions, and communicated next steps. 4) Milestones Timeline (high-level) A concise view of major deliverables and delivery phases. (Dates shown only where clearly available in artefacts.) 2023: ViewPoint/VPoint — migration data integrity analysis and governance work; BAU investigations and workflow change requests. Feb–Mar 2024: VScreen — SLA/KPI definition and screening roles framework; early reporting enablement. Jun–Jul 2024: VScreen — QC model refined (sampling methodology, reporting templates) and dashboard build artefacts. Jun 2025: Client Onboarding programme — governance updates; UAT planning and readiness activities captured in programme packs. Sep 2025: Standardised journey validation via structured test scenario packs. 5) Case Studies (tight) Each case study is interview-ready: situation → role → actions → result. (6–8 lines each.) Case Study A — VScreen enterprise MI enablement (Power BI access model) Situation: Stakeholders needed broader access to screening MI without exposing cross-jurisdiction data. Role: Defined and explained the access model and how users request/receive access. Action: Confirmed enterprise dashboard access patterns and articulated jurisdiction-restricted visibility rules. Action: Introduced a controlled access workflow to track requests and approvals. Action: Clarified data sourcing approach and how dashboards are refreshed. Result: Standardised rollout communications and reduced ambiguity in access governance. Case Study B — VScreen SLA/KPI framework definition Situation: Operational performance needed a consistent SLA/KPI framework across screening roles. Role: Authored the SLA/KPI guide to define responsibilities and measurement scope. Action: Documented role responsibilities and category prioritisation (including sanctions emphasis). Action: Set scope boundaries (what is measured vs out of scope) to prevent inconsistent reporting. Action: Provided a reusable baseline to support MI, RAG status and operational oversight. Result: Enabled consistent interpretation of operational performance across jurisdictions. Case Study C — VScreen QC operating model (process + templates) Situation: Post go-live QC needed a repeatable approach for consistent screening outcomes. Role: Updated QC process documentation and enabled standard templates. Action: Refined expected process and sampling methodology. Action: Enabled jurisdiction-level QC reporting structure and template-driven outputs. Action: Used QC outputs to drive coaching and continuous improvement conversations. Result: Established a scalable QC mechanism suitable for operational governance. Case Study D — Fenergo configuration analysis (journeys/policy/risk) Situation: Early implementation required clarity on configuration work needed for the operating model. Role: Produced a structured configuration requirements analysis for stakeholder review. Action: Documented current state vs required enhancements across journeys, policies and risk framework. Action: Highlighted jurisdiction gaps and integration limitations (manual process implications). Action: Framed work into clear configuration areas to support prioritised working sessions. Result: Created a shared reference for delivery planning and cross-team alignment. Case Study E — Bulk upload scheduling remediation (launch date validation) Situation: Bulk updates were rejected when review launch dates exceeded due dates. Role: Owned diagnosis and remediation approach for scheduling logic. Action: Recalculated launch dates to align with due dates using risk-based offsets. Action: Defined a test-first rollout approach before updating the full population. Action: Managed exceptions for long-dated records where system constraints were suspected. Result: Unblocked bulk scheduling updates and stabilised the approach for scaled updates. Case Study F — Programme cadence (UAT readiness &amp; reporting alignment) Situation: Multiple workstreams needed tight coordination (process, UAT, reporting, SOPs, readiness). Role: Contributed to governance rhythm via weekly update packs and readiness sequencing. Action: Tracked status across SME engagement, checklist consolidation, training/UAT and reporting development. Action: Clarified UAT sequencing (intro → testing → scenarios → fixes/retest → readiness criteria). Action: Maintained alignment between workflow changes and reporting expectations. Result: Improved clarity of progress and readiness across stakeholders and locations. 6) Artefact Catalogue (titles only) High-signal artefacts referenced by this portfolio.
